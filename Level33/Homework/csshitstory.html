    <p> <i>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) has a rich history that reflects its evolution from a basic styling language to a powerful tool used in modern web design. Here's a brief overview of its development:</i>

        <b>1994: Håkon Wium Lie proposed CSS while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. The idea was to separate content from presentation, which would allow HTML to focus on structure and semantics while CSS handled visual style.</b>
        <h2>CSS1</h2>
        1996: The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) officially released CSS1. This first version introduced basic styling capabilities, such as fonts, colors, and margins. It was a significant step forward from inline styles and presentational HTML attributes.
        <h2>CSS2</h2
        1998: CSS2 was published and brought many improvements, including:
        Positioning: Relative, absolute, and fixed positioning.
        Z-index: Layering of elements.
        Media Types: Different styles for different devices (screen, print, etc.).
        Selectors: Enhanced selectors for more precise styling.
        <h2>CSS2.1</h2>
        2011: CSS2.1 became the official recommendation, refining CSS2 with bug fixes and clarifications. It became the basis for many web standards and implementations.
        <h2>CSS3</h2>
        2011: CSS3 was introduced with modularization, meaning that rather than one monolithic specification, CSS3 is divided into modules. This allowed different features to be developed and released independently. Key features introduced include:
        Selectors: Advanced selectors like attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements.
        Box Model: Border-radius, box shadows, and gradients.
        Layout: Flexbox and Grid Layout for more complex layouts.
        Animations: Keyframe animations and transitions.
        Ongoing: While there's no formal CSS4 specification, modern CSS continues to evolve. New modules and features are continually added, such as:
        CSS Grid Layout: Provides a powerful system for creating complex web layouts.
        CSS Variables (Custom Properties): Allowing for reusable values and easier theming.
        CSS Houdini: A set of APIs that provide developers with more control over styling and layout.
         includes advancements like container queries, which allow responsive designs based on the size of a container rather than the viewport. Additionally, there’s ongoing work on features like CSS subgrid, CSS Scroll Snap, and enhanced support for CSS-in-JS libraries.
        The history of CSS reflects the broader evolution of web design and development, from simple static pages to dynamic, responsive, and interactive experiences.</p>
