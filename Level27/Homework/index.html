        first I was very interested in mobile phones and computers. I used both but I used them unproductively and wasted my time. After that I got interested in programming and searched for a very long time for a reliable and cool place.2 I found Goa and I was very happy that I entered. Because the coolest place to learn programming is the best place, with the best mentors, I love Goa very much and I think I will become a future programmer.I advise everyone to enter and do programming and not waste time on nonsense, this is their future</p>
